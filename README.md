#NMR Methods:
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed for NSCLC cell lines. Cells were plated in 175 cm2 T-Flasks: H292 (1.5×107 cells/flask); A549 (2×107 cells/flask), and PC-9 (2.5×107 cells/flask).
Cells were cultured in control conditions for 24 h. Culture media was collected and stored at -80°C.
Cell methanol/chloroform/water extracts were performed to separate aqueous (methanol/water) and organic (chloroform) phases. 
The aqueous phase was lyophilized in a SpeedVac Plus system and was suspended in deuterated water (D2O) with 0.04% (v/v) azide, and 0.32 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) was used as chemical shift reference and concentration standard. 
For extracellular metabolites analysis, 30 μL of 3.2 mM TSP and 30 µL of 0.4% (v/v) sodium azide in D2O were added to 540 μL of supernatants (conditioned culture media).
1H-NMR spectra were obtained at 25°C in an UltrashieldTM Avance 500 Plus spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a cryo-prodigy TCI-Z probe, using a noesypr1d pulse program. 
Spectra were acquired and processed using TopSpin 4.1 software (Bruker) and the assignments were made by resorting to spectral databases: Human Metabolome (HMDB) and Chenomx NMR Suite 8.11 were used to determine the concentration of the metabolites.
